## Key Assumptions Made

### 1. Exchange Rates
- **Static FX Rates**: Used fixed conversion rates (1 USD = 129.50 KES, 1 USD = 1650.00 NGN)
- **Base Currency**: USD used as base for all conversions
- **Rate Application**: Rates applied instantly without spread or fees

### 2. Account Structure
- **Account Types**: Categorized as Mobile Money (Mpesa), Bank, and Wallet accounts
- **Initial Balances**: Pre-populated with realistic amounts for demonstration
- **Account IDs**: Used kebab-case naming convention for consistency

### 3. Transaction Processing
- **Instant Settlement**: All transfers process immediately without delays
- **Transaction IDs**: Auto-generated using timestamp-based unique identifiers
- **Status Tracking**: All transactions marked as "completed" for simplicity

### 4. Data Persistence
- **Client-Side Storage**: Data stored in React state (resets on page refresh)
- **No Backend**: Fully frontend solution without database integration
- **Mock Data**: Initial accounts and sample transactions for demonstration

### 5. Business Logic
- **Transfer Limits**: No minimum/maximum transfer amounts implemented
- **Operating Hours**: 24/7 availability without business hour restrictions
- **Compliance**: No KYC/AML validation or regulatory checks

## Improvements for Production

### üîß Technical Enhancements
1. **Backend Integration**: Express.js API with PostgreSQL/MongoDB for data persistence
2. **Real-time FX Rates**: Integration with live exchange rate APIs (e.g., Fixer.io, CurrencyAPI)
3. **Authentication**: User login/logout with JWT token management
4. **API Security**: Rate limiting, input validation, and CORS configuration

### üìä Feature Additions
1. **Future-dated Transfers**: Scheduling system with date/time picker
2. **Bulk Transfers**: CSV upload for multiple transactions
3. **Transfer Limits**: Daily/monthly limits with approval workflows
4. **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging
5. **Reporting**: Export capabilities (PDF, CSV, Excel) with date ranges

### üè¶ Business Logic
1. **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple organizations/users

3. **Role-based Access**: Granular permissions for different user types
4. **Fraud Detection**: ML-based anomaly detection for suspicious activities

## Technical Decisions Rationale

### Framework Choice
- **React.js**: Chosen for component reusability and modern development practices
- **Functional Components**: Used hooks for cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Client-side State**: Appropriate for demo; would use Redux/Zustand for production

### Styling Approach
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid development with consistent design system
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built components for professional appearance
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach for accessibility

### Code Organization
- **Component Separation**: Modular architecture for maintainability
- **Data Layer**: Centralized data management in dedicated folder
- **Utility Functions**: Reusable helpers for currency formatting and conversion
